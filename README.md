## k8s
This is my kubernetes repo

Copy the above script into a file, e.g., create-nginx-pod.sh, and make it executable:
# chmod +x create-nginx-pod.sh

To run the script, execute the following command:
# ./create-nginx-pod.sh

The script will create the Nginx pod, verify its status, and set up port forwarding to access the Nginx web server.

Note: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and the Kubernetes environment is properly set up before running the script.
